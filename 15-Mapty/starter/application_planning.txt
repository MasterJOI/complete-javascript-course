Application planning

1. User stories
Features description from user side:
I want to log my running workouts with location, distance, time, pace and steps pre minute
I want to log my running cycling with location, distance, time, speed and elevation gain
I want to see all my workouts at a glance
I want to see all my workouts at a map
I want to see all my workouts when I live and come back later

2. Compile a main features from stories
1) Map where user clicks to add a new workout (to get location coordinates)
2) Use geolocation of user to display suitable part of the map
3) Form to input all the data for running4) Form to input all the data for cycling5) Display a list of saved workouts
6) Display all workouts on the map
7) Save user data somewhere (simply in local storage) and load from it

3. Create a flow chart
1) Page loads -> get location coords -> render map in this location
2) User clicks on map -> render workout form
3) User submits new workout -> render workout in list and on map -> store workouts in local storage
4) user refresh page -> (map loaded) -> load and render workouts from local storage
5) User clicks on workout on map -> move map to center of location

4. Architecture
In which form it will be implemented
1. Decide where and how to store the data
